## ⚡ What is Mergen?

**Mergen** is a next-generation database management tool designed to bridge the gap between **native performance** and **modern web aesthetics**. 

Unlike clunky, legacy SQL clients, Mergen offers a buttery-smooth experience with a focus on visual clarity. Written in **Go** and **React**, it starts instantly, runs everywhere, and looks beautiful doing it.

## ✨ Key Features

### 🚀 **Native Performance**
Powered by a **Go** backend and the **Wails** framework, Mergen consumes a fraction of the memory of Electron-based apps while delivering native-speed query execution.

- **Multi-Tab Interface**: juggle multiple queries and table views simultaneously without losing context.

### 📊 **Visual Data Editor**
- **Spreadsheet-like Editing**: Double-click to edit cells, add rows, or delete data.
- **Safe Mode**: Changes are staged before committing, preventing accidental data loss.

### 📥 **Universal Data Export**
